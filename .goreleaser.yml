    # If your Dockerfile copies files other than the binary itself,
    # you should list them here as well.
    # Note that goreleaser will create the same structure inside the temporary
    # folder, so if you add `foo/bar.json` here, on your Dockerfile you can
    # `COPY foo/bar.json /whatever.json`.
    # Also note that the paths here are relative to the folder in which
    # goreleaser is being run.
    # This field does not support wildcards, you can add an entire folder here
    # and use wildcards when you `COPY`/`ADD` in your Dockerfile.
